**Project Overview: Power BI Wait List Analysis:-**

**Introduction:-**
This Power BI project aims to analyze wait list data across various medical case types and demographics. By providing insights into average and median wait times, the project enables healthcare administrators to identify trends and areas for improvement in patient management and resource allocation.

**Key Visualizations**

Average/Median Wait List by Case Type


The project includes a detailed breakdown of average and median wait lists for different case types, such as Outpatient, Day Case, and Inpatient. The data shows the percentage distribution of wait times, highlighting which case types have the longest wait periods. For instance, Outpatient cases represent 72.49% of the wait list metrics.


Average/Median Wait List by Time Bands and Age Profile


This visualization categorizes wait times based on age profiles and time bands, measuring the effectiveness of patient throughput. Age profiles include groups like 0-15, 16-64, and 65+, while time bands represent various wait periods from 0-3 months to over 18 months. The data helps in assessing how different age groups experience wait times for treatment.


Wait List by Specialty and Archive Date


This analysis provides insights into wait lists segmented by medical specialties over the years, from 2019 to 2021. It visualizes the total wait list figures archived over time, enabling stakeholders to track changes in patient demand and service delivery effectiveness.


Detailed View of Time Bands and Case Types


The project includes a granular view of wait list data by specific time bands for each case type. This detailed view allows administrators to pinpoint delays in care and identify case types that may need additional resources or process improvements.


Sum of Total by Specialty


This visualization aggregates total wait list figures by specialty, offering a clear comparison of demand across different medical fields. This insight is essential for strategic planning and resource allocation within healthcare facilities.


**Project Goal:-**
1. Track Current status of patient waiting list
2. Analyze historically monthly trend of waiting list in Inpatient & Outpatient categories.
3. Detailed speciality level & age profile analysis.

Data Scope:- 2018 - 2021

**Metrics Required:-**
1. Average & Median Waiting List
2. Current Total Wait List


**Views Required:-**
1. Summary Page
2. Detailed Page for Granular Analysis.

**Conclusion:-**
The Power BI Wait List Analysis project serves as a crucial tool for healthcare administrators to understand wait list dynamics. By leveraging visualizations that cover various dimensions such as case types, age profiles, and specialties, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions aimed at enhancing patient care and optimizing operational efficiency. The insights gained from this analysis will help in addressing wait time challenges and improving overall healthcare delivery.
